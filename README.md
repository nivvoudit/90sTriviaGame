TriviaGame - A simple quiz based on 90s trivia made in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Firebase. 

Don't you just MISS the 90s? From JNCO jeans, pogs and Saturday morning cartoons, to Beavis and Butthead, NOW Greatest Hits compilation cds and dial-up internet (okay, let's be honest, we don't really miss slow internet but it still remains an integral part of our childhood if you were a 90s kid). But I digress. 

Why not take the 90s challenge? If you get 100%, you win...a high-five from me! (and I've been told my high-fives are pretty world-class).

Thanks so much and enjoy!
